# Universal Jailbreak Suffixes Are Strong Attention Hijackers ü•∑
The official repository for the paper [‚ÄúUniversal Jailbreak Suffixes Are Strong Attention Hijackers‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12880), analyzing the underlying mechanism of suffix-based LLM jailbreaks, and exploiting it to enhance and mitigate existing jailbreaks.

## Setup
The project requires Python `3.1.0` and the installation of `requirements.txt`, preferably in an isolated environment, as it includes a [fork of TransformerLens](https://github.com/matanbt/TransformerLens) (othewise, this could override existing installation of TransformerLens).

## Usage

Common entry points are demonstrated in the [demo notebook](./demo.ipynb). There, we reproduce the initial GCG universality analysis (¬ß3), calculation of the *dominance score* (Eq. 3, ¬ß5) over different prompts, which can be aggregated per GCG suffix, leading to their *hijacking strength* (¬ß6).

## Additional Usage

## Additional Research Artifacts
Some of our additional research artifacts (which are used in this code) may be useful for further/other types of analyses.
- **The GCG suffixes dataset** for further exploring GCG suffixes.
    - GCG suffixes crafted on Gemma-2, Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3.1, their generated response when appended to harmful instructions (from AdvBench, StrongReject's custom), their evaluation and charecterization.
    - In HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MatanBT/gcg-evaluated-data
- **TransformerLens fork** for further exploring the dominance score.
    - Adds to TransformerLens support of fine-grained attention hooks to enable the calculation of dominance score.
